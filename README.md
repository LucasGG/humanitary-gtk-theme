# Humanitary Theme

A fork of the [elementary GTK theme](https://launchpad.net/egtk) using the grey & brown palettes of old-school Ubuntu themes for a bit of nostaligia.

Like the original theme, this one is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Redistributing, forking, remixing, etc. is encouraged!

**Note: this theme was created simply for a moment of nostaligia, there were no plans to update it or expand support. However, if you would like to maintain it further feel free to fork it.**

## Installation

To use "Humanitary" copy the theme to your Home folder:

    cp -r Humanitary/ $HOME/.local/share/themes/Humanitary

and choose it from a tweak tool or use the terminal:
